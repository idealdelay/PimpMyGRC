# PimpMyGRC

I started out wanting the simplest thing imaginable in GNU Radio:
a plain black background so my eyes could survive late-night
debugging, and somehow that tiny request snowballed into a full-
blown Geocities monstrosity with loud gradients, chaotic accents,
and enough visual noise to make every flowgraph feel like a 1999
fan page. It is the definition of a first-world problem: I have
powerful SDR tools, real technical work to do, and my biggest
daily obstacle is that my interface now looks like it lost a
fight with a glitter GIF archive, all because I tried to make one
harmless cosmetic tweak.
